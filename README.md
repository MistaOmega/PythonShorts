# Python Shorts

Some of the code I use for my Python Youtube Shorts

## Numpy Vs Python & Numpy Vs JIT
These two folders contain code for a two-part short collection measuring the performance of NumPy vs Vanilla Python and NumPy vs Python using Just In Time (JIT) Compilation

These will make arrays from 10 - 100,000,000 elements in size working in powers of 10

Then the two sum functions are timed on how quick they can add all the elements in each array

Then matplotlib plots the results

### Requirements
- Numba (For JIT decorator)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (For plotting)

You can use pip for this, e.g:
`pip install numpy`
